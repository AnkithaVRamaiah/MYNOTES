# **Everything About Kubernetes (K8s) in Simple Words**  

Kubernetes (K8s) is an **open-source container orchestration platform** that helps deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications automatically. It ensures applications run smoothly across multiple machines (nodes).  

---

## **Why Do We Need Kubernetes?**  

Before Kubernetes, managing containers manually was difficult. Challenges included:  
‚úÖ Running multiple containers on different servers  
‚úÖ Restarting failed containers  
‚úÖ Scaling applications up or down  
‚úÖ Networking between containers  

Kubernetes **solves these problems** by automating deployment, scaling, and management of containers.

---

## **Key Concepts of Kubernetes**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Cluster**  
A **Kubernetes cluster** is a group of machines (nodes) that run applications.  

- **Master Node (Control Plane)** ‚Üí Manages the cluster.  
- **Worker Nodes** ‚Üí Run the applications in containers.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Pods**  
A **Pod** is the smallest unit in Kubernetes. It contains **one or more containers** that share storage and networking.  

üí° Example: A web app and a database running in the same pod.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Deployments**  
A **Deployment** ensures that the correct number of pods are running. If a pod crashes, Kubernetes automatically replaces it.  

üí° Example: If you deploy 3 replicas of your web app and one crashes, K8s restarts it automatically.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Services**  
A **Service** helps expose applications inside and outside the cluster. It ensures communication between pods and users.  

üí° Example: A web application needs a **LoadBalancer Service** to be accessible from the internet.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Ingress**  
An **Ingress** is like a traffic controller for Kubernetes. It routes requests from users to the correct services inside the cluster.  

üí° Example: `www.myapp.com/api` ‚Üí Routes traffic to the backend API service.  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **ConfigMaps & Secrets**  
- **ConfigMaps** store **non-sensitive** configuration data (e.g., environment variables).  
- **Secrets** store **sensitive** information like passwords and API keys.  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Volumes** (Storage in Kubernetes)  
Kubernetes allows containers to store data using **Volumes** so that data is not lost when a pod restarts.  

üí° Example: An application that saves user data in a database.  

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Autoscaling**  
Kubernetes automatically **scales up or down** based on traffic and resource usage.  
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** ‚Üí Adds more pods when CPU/memory increases.  
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** ‚Üí Increases or decreases pod resources.  

---

## **Kubernetes Architecture**  

üîπ **Control Plane (Master Node)**  
- **API Server**: The entry point for all requests to the cluster.  
- **Scheduler**: Assigns new pods to worker nodes.  
- **Controller Manager**: Ensures desired state (e.g., keeps 3 replicas running).  
- **ETCD**: Stores cluster data.  

üîπ **Worker Nodes**  
- **Kubelet**: Runs on each worker node, ensuring pods run correctly.  
- **Container Runtime (Docker, containerd, etc.)**: Runs containers.  
- **Kube Proxy**: Handles networking inside the cluster.

## **Hands-on: Kubernetes Commands**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Deployment**
```bash
kubectl create deployment myapp --image=nginx --replicas=3
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Expose the Deployment as a Service**
```bash
kubectl expose deployment myapp --type=LoadBalancer --port=80
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ List Running Pods**
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Scale the Deployment (Increase Pods)**
```bash
kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=5
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Delete a Deployment**
```bash
kubectl delete deployment myapp
```

Here‚Äôs a **step-by-step guide** on setting up a Kubernetes cluster from scratch! üöÄ  

---

# **Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster (Step-by-Step)**
We will set up a **Kubernetes cluster** with:  
‚úÖ **1 Master Node** (Control Plane)  
‚úÖ **2 Worker Nodes** (Where applications run)  

---

## **Step 1: Prepare Your Machines**  
You need **3 virtual machines (VMs)** running Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or later).  
For each VM, set up the following configurations:  
- **Master Node**: 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM  
- **Worker Nodes**: 2 CPUs, 2GB RAM each  
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  

### **Set Hostnames**
On each machine, set the hostname:  
- **Master Node:**  
  ```bash
  sudo hostnamectl set-hostname master-node
  ```
- **Worker Nodes:**  
  ```bash
  sudo hostnamectl set-hostname worker-node-1
  sudo hostnamectl set-hostname worker-node-2
  ```

---

## **Step 2: Install Docker** (Container Runtime)
Run these commands on **all nodes** (Master + Workers):  

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y docker.io
```

Enable and start Docker:  
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

---

## **Step 3: Install Kubernetes Components (Kubeadm, Kubelet, Kubectl)**
Run these commands on **all nodes** (Master + Workers):

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
curl -fsSL https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo systemctl enable kubelet
```

---

## **Step 4: Disable Swap** (Required for Kubernetes)
```bash
sudo swapoff -a
sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^/#/' /etc/fstab
```

---

## **Step 5: Initialize the Kubernetes Cluster (Master Node Only)**
Run this command **only on the Master Node**:  
```bash
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.1.0/16
```
After successful setup, you‚Äôll see a command like this:  
```bash
kubeadm join <MASTER_IP>:6443 --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>
```
Copy this command. You‚Äôll use it to **join worker nodes**.

---

## **Step 6: Configure Kubectl for Master Node**
Run the following commands **on the Master Node** to start using Kubernetes:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

---

## **Step 7: Install a Network Plugin**
A **network plugin** is required for communication between pods.  
Run this **only on the Master Node**:  

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
```

Verify the pods are running:  
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

---

## **Step 8: Join Worker Nodes to the Cluster**
Run the **join command** (copied from Step 5) on **each Worker Node**:

```bash
kubeadm join <MASTER_IP>:6443 --token <TOKEN> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<HASH>
```

To check if nodes joined successfully, go back to the **Master Node** and run:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
You should see:
```
NAME            STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
master-node     Ready    control-plane   5m    v1.27
worker-node-1   Ready    <none>   2m    v1.27
worker-node-2   Ready    <none>   2m    v1.27
```

---

## **Step 9: Deploy a Test Application**
Let‚Äôs deploy **NGINX** to test the cluster:  
```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
kubectl expose deployment nginx --type=NodePort --port=80
```

Check if the pods are running:  
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

Find the **NodePort** assigned to the service:  
```bash
kubectl get svc
```
You‚Äôll see an output like this:
```
NAME         TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx        NodePort   10.96.202.187   <none>        80:30007/TCP   1m
```
Now, you can access NGINX using:  
```bash
http://<Worker-Node-IP>:30007
```

---

## **Step 10: Verify Everything is Working**
```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get svc
```

üéâ **Congratulations! Your Kubernetes cluster is set up!** üéâ
