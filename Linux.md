## **1. Introduction to Linux**
- **Linux** is an open-source, Unix-like operating system based on the **Linux kernel**, created by **Linus Torvalds** in 1991.
- It is free to use, modify, and distribute.
- Linux is popular for servers, cloud computing, embedded systems, and DevOps environments.

## **2. Features of Linux**
1. **Open-source** – The source code is freely available.
2. **Multi-user** – Multiple users can use the system simultaneously.
3. **Multi-tasking** – Supports running multiple processes at the same time.
4. **Portability** – Runs on various hardware platforms (PCs, servers, mobile devices).
5. **Security** – File permissions, user authentication, and firewalls ensure security.
6. **Stability** – Rarely crashes and can run for long durations without rebooting.
7. **Shell Scripting** – Automates tasks using shell scripts.
8. **Networking Support** – Comes with built-in network tools and services.

## **3. Linux Architecture**
The Linux OS is structured into several layers:

1. **Hardware** – Physical components (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).
2. **Kernel** – The core of Linux that interacts with hardware and manages system resources.
3. **Shell** – A command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the OS.
4. **System Utilities** – Provides basic functions like file handling, process management, etc.
5. **User Applications** – Programs and applications run by users.

## **4. Linux Kernel**
The **Linux Kernel** is the heart of the OS. It performs:
- **Process management** – Scheduling and execution of processes.
- **Memory management** – Allocating and deallocating memory.
- **Device drivers** – Managing hardware devices.
- **File system management** – Handling files and directories.
- **Network management** – Managing network communication.

## **5. Linux File System Structure**
Linux follows a hierarchical **directory structure**, starting from the root (`/`).

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | Root directory |
| `/bin` | Essential system binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/boot` | Boot files, including the Linux kernel |
| `/etc` | Configuration files |
| `/home` | User home directories |
| `/lib` | Shared libraries for system binaries |
| `/mnt` | Mount points for temporary file systems |
| `/opt` | Optional software packages |
| `/root` | Home directory of the root user |
| `/sbin` | System administration binaries |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/usr` | User utilities and applications |
| `/var` | Variable files (logs, databases, etc.) |

## **6. Linux Distributions (Distros)**
A **Linux distribution** is a customized version of Linux that includes the kernel, utilities, and applications.

### **Popular Linux Distributions**
- **For beginners:** Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS
- **For advanced users:** Arch Linux, Gentoo, Slackware
- **For servers:** CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu Server, RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
- **For security professionals:** Kali Linux, Parrot OS

## **7. Linux Command Line Interface (CLI)**
The Linux CLI is a powerful tool for system management.

### **Basic Linux Commands**
- `pwd` – Print current directory.
- `ls` – List files and directories.
- `cd` – Change directory.
- `mkdir` – Create a directory.
- `rm` – Remove files/directories.
- `cp` – Copy files/directories.
- `mv` – Move/rename files.
- `cat` – View file contents.
- `echo` – Print text to the terminal.
- `chmod` – Change file permissions.
- `chown` – Change file ownership.

### **Process Management Commands**
- `ps` – Display running processes.
- `top` – Monitor system processes in real-time.
- `kill` – Terminate a process.
- `htop` – Interactive process viewer.

### **Networking Commands**
- `ifconfig` / `ip a` – Display network interfaces.
- `ping` – Check connectivity.
- `netstat` – Show network connections.
- `ssh` – Securely connect to remote systems.

### **File Permission Commands**
- `ls -l` – Show file permissions.
- `chmod` – Modify file permissions.
- `chown` – Change file ownership.

## **8. User Management in Linux**
- `whoami` – Show the current user.
- `who` – Show logged-in users.
- `adduser` – Create a new user.
- `deluser` – Delete a user.
- `passwd` – Change user password.
- `usermod` – Modify user details.

---

## **9. Linux Process Management**
- **Foreground process** – Runs in the active terminal.
- **Background process** – Runs in the background (`&` operator).
- `jobs` – List background jobs.
- `fg` – Bring a background process to the foreground.
- `bg` – Resume a suspended process in the background.

---

## **10. Shell Scripting in Linux**
A **shell script** automates tasks using Linux commands.

Example of a simple shell script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Linux!"
date
```
- `#!/bin/bash` – Specifies the script should run in the Bash shell.
- `echo` – Prints text to the terminal.
