## **3. Linux Architecture**
The Linux OS is structured into several layers:

1. **Hardware** ‚Äì Physical components (CPU, memory, storage, etc.).
2. **Kernel** ‚Äì The core of Linux that interacts with hardware and manages system resources.
3. **Shell** ‚Äì A command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the OS.
4. **System Utilities** ‚Äì Provides basic functions like file handling, process management, etc.

## **5. Linux File System Structure**
Linux follows a hierarchical **directory structure**, starting from the root (`/`).

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | Root directory |
| `/bin` | Essential system binaries (e.g., `ls`, `cp`, `mv`) |
| `/boot` | Boot files, including the Linux kernel |
| `/etc` | Configuration files |
| `/home` | User home directories |
| `/lib` | Shared libraries for system binaries |
| `/mnt` | Mount points for temporary file systems |
| `/opt` | Optional software packages |
| `/root` | Home directory of the root user |
| `/sbin` | System administration binaries |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/usr` | User utilities and applications |
| `/var` | Variable files (logs, databases, etc.) |

### üìÅ **Top-Level Directories in Linux**
1. **`/` (Root)**
   - The starting point of everything in Linux.
   - All other directories are inside this.

2. **`/bin` (Binary)**
   - Contains essential command-line programs like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, etc.
   - These commands are available to all users.

3. **`/sbin` (System Binary)**
   - Similar to `/bin`, but contains system-related commands like `shutdown`, `mount`, `fsck`.
   - Used mostly by system administrators.

4. **`/home` (User Home Directory)**
   - Each user gets a folder here (`/home/ankita` for example).
   - Stores personal files, documents, and configurations.

5. **`/root` (Root User's Home)**
   - Home directory for the `root` (admin) user.
   - Separate from `/home` to prevent accidental changes.

6. **`/etc` (Configuration Files)**
   - Stores system and application configuration files.
   - Example: `/etc/passwd` (user accounts), `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` (SSH settings).

7. **`/var` (Variable Data)**
   - Stores frequently changing files like logs, emails, and databases.
   - Example: `/var/log/syslog` (system logs), `/var/www` (web server files).

8. **`/tmp` (Temporary Files)**
   - Used for temporary files that get deleted on reboot.
   - Example: Apps store temporary data here.

9. **`/usr` (User Programs)**
   - Stores installed applications and libraries for users.
   - `/usr/bin` (non-essential binaries), `/usr/lib` (libraries), `/usr/share` (documentation).

10. **`/opt` (Optional Software)**
   - Third-party software like custom applications are installed here.

11. **`/dev` (Device Files)**
   - Represents hardware devices as files.
   - Example: `/dev/sda` (hard disk), `/dev/tty` (terminal).

12. **`/proc` (Process Information)**
   - Contains system and process information in real-time.
   - Example: `/proc/cpuinfo` (CPU details), `/proc/meminfo` (memory info).

13. **`/sys` (System Information)**
   - Similar to `/proc` but used for kernel-related files.
   - Example: `/sys/class/net/` (network interfaces).

14. **`/boot` (Boot Files)**
   - Stores files needed for booting the system, including the Linux kernel (`vmlinuz`).
   - Example: `/boot/grub` (bootloader files).

15. **`/lib` & `/lib64` (Libraries)**
   - Contains essential system libraries required for basic commands.
   - Example: `/lib/libc.so.6` (C standard library).

16. **`/mnt` & `/media` (Mount Points)**
   - `/mnt`: Temporary mount points for external devices.
   - `/media`: Automatically mounted removable drives like USB, CD-ROM.
