Sure! Let's go step by step and cover **everything about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**, along with interview questions and answers.

# **1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**  
**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**. An object is an instance of a **class** that contains **attributes (variables)** and **methods (functions).**

✅ **Key Benefits of OOP:**  
✔ Code **reusability** using classes and objects  
✔ Increases **modularity** (dividing code into small parts)  
✔ Makes **maintenance and debugging** easier  
✔ Helps in **real-world modeling** (bank accounts, cars, employees, etc.)

# **2. Four Pillars of OOP**
Python OOP is built on **four main principles:**

### **1. Encapsulation** 🏦  
Encapsulation is the **binding of data and methods** together within a class, restricting direct access to some details.  

✔ **Example:**
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private variable (cannot be accessed directly)
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance  # Accessing private variable via method

account = BankAccount(1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
```
✅ **Key Points:**  
- Private variables are defined using `__` (double underscore).  
- You cannot access `account.__balance` directly.  

---

### **2. Inheritance** 👨‍👦  
Inheritance allows a class to **inherit properties and methods** from another class.  

✔ **Example:**
```python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Some generic sound"

class Dog(Animal):  # Inheriting Animal class
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Bark"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.make_sound())  # Output: Bark
```
✅ **Key Points:**  
- The `Dog` class **inherits** from the `Animal` class.  
- `Dog` **overrides** the `make_sound()` method.  

---

### **3. Polymorphism** 🦸‍♂️  
Polymorphism allows the **same method to have different behaviors** based on the object calling it.  

✔ **Example:**
```python
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        return "Birds can fly"

class Penguin(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        return "Penguins cannot fly"

def flight_test(bird):
    print(bird.fly())

sparrow = Bird()
penguin = Penguin()

flight_test(sparrow)  # Output: Birds can fly
flight_test(penguin)  # Output: Penguins cannot fly
```
✅ **Key Points:**  
- The `fly()` method behaves differently for `Bird` and `Penguin`.  
- This is called **method overriding**.

---

### **4. Abstraction** 🔍  
Abstraction hides the **complexity** and **only shows the essential details**.  

✔ **Example using ABC (Abstract Base Class):**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Vehicle(ABC):  # Abstract class
    @abstractmethod
    def start_engine(self):
        pass  # No implementation

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start_engine(self):
        return "Car engine started"

car = Car()
print(car.start_engine())  # Output: Car engine started
```
✅ **Key Points:**  
- `@abstractmethod` means **must be implemented** in subclasses.  
- We **cannot create objects** of abstract classes.

---

# **3. Classes and Objects in Python**
### **Class:** A **blueprint/template** for creating objects.  
### **Object:** An **instance** of a class.  

✔ **Example:**
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand  # Instance variable
        self.model = model  # Instance variable

    def display_info(self):
        return f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}"

my_car = Car("Toyota", "Camry")  # Creating an object
print(my_car.display_info())  # Output: Car: Toyota Camry
```
✅ **Key Points:**  
- `self` refers to the **current object instance**.  
- `__init__()` is the **constructor**, executed when an object is created.

# **4. OOP Interview Questions & Answers**
### **Basic-Level Questions:**
✅ **Q1: What is OOP?**  
💡 **Answer:** OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that uses classes and objects to structure the code, following principles like **Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction**.

✅ **Q2: What is a class and an object?**  
💡 **Answer:**  
- A **class** is a template/blueprint for creating objects.  
- An **object** is an instance of a class.

✅ **Q3: What is the difference between a function and a method?**  
💡 **Answer:**  
- A **function** is a reusable block of code defined using `def` in Python.  
- A **method** is a function that belongs to a class and operates on objects.

---

### **Intermediate-Level Questions:**
✅ **Q4: What is `self` in Python?**  
💡 **Answer:** `self` represents the **current instance** of the class. It allows us to access variables and methods of the object.

✅ **Q5: What is `__init__()` in Python?**  
💡 **Answer:** `__init__()` is the **constructor method** in Python. It initializes instance variables when an object is created.

✅ **Q6: What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?**  
💡 **Answer:**  
- **Method Overloading** (Not directly supported in Python) means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.  
- **Method Overriding** means redefining a parent class method in a child class.

---

### **Advanced-Level Questions:**
✅ **Q7: What is the difference between `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and an instance method?**  
💡 **Answer:**  
- **Instance method:** Uses `self`, operates on instance variables.  
- **Class method:** Uses `@classmethod`, operates on class variables.  
- **Static method:** Uses `@staticmethod`, does not access class or instance variables.

✔ **Example:**
```python
class Demo:
    class_variable = "I am a class variable"

    def instance_method(self):
        return "I am an instance method"

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        return f"Accessing: {cls.class_variable}"

    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        return "I am a static method"

obj = Demo()
print(obj.instance_method())  # Instance method
print(Demo.class_method())  # Class method
print(Demo.static_method())  # Static method
```

✅ **Q8: What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported in Python?**  
💡 **Answer:** Yes, Python supports **multiple inheritance**, where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes.  

✔ **Example:**
```python
class A:
    def method_A(self):
        return "Method from class A"

class B:
    def method_B(self):
        return "Method from class B"

class C(A, B):  # Multiple inheritance
    pass

obj = C()
print(obj.method_A())  # Output: Method from class A
print(obj.method_B())  # Output: Method from class B
```

# **5. Summary**
✅ **OOP is based on:**  
✔ **Encapsulation** – Protects data (private variables)  
✔ **Inheritance** – Allows reuse of code (parent-child relationship)  
✔ **Polymorphism** – Same method, different behavior  
✔ **Abstraction** – Hides complex implementation  

✅ **OOP makes code:**  
✔ More modular, reusable, and maintainable
