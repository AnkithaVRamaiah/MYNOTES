# **Basics of Python and Python Scripting**  

## **1. What is Python?**  
**Python** is a programming language used for automation, web development, data analysis, and more. It is popular because:  
✔️ It is **easy to learn** (simple syntax).  
✔️ It is **powerful** (used in AI, DevOps, scripting, etc.).  
✔️ It is **cross-platform** (runs on Windows, Linux, Mac).

## **2. Python Basics (Simple Q&A Format)**  

### **Q1: How do you write and run a Python script?**  
A **Python script** is a file with the `.py` extension that contains Python code.  

**Steps to run a Python script:**  
1. Open a text editor (VS Code, Notepad, PyCharm).  
2. Write Python code and save it as `script.py`.  
3. Open a terminal and run:  
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

### **Q2: What are variables in Python?**  
A **variable** is a name that stores data. Example:  
```python
name = "Ankita"
age = 25
```
Here, `name` stores `"Ankita"` and `age` stores `25`.  

---

### **Q3: What are data types in Python?**  
Python has different **data types** to store values.  

| Data Type | Example | Used for |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `int` | `x = 10` | Numbers |
| `float` | `pi = 3.14` | Decimal numbers |
| `str` | `name = "Ankita"` | Text |
| `bool` | `is_ready = True` | True/False values |
| `list` | `fruits = ["apple", "banana"]` | Collection of items |
| `tuple` | `months = ("Jan", "Feb")` | Fixed collection of items |
| `dict` | `person = {"name": "Ankita", "age": 25}` | Key-value pairs |

### **Q4: What are operators in Python?**  
**Operators** perform actions on values.  

✅ **Arithmetic Operators**  
```python
x = 10 + 5  # Addition (+)
y = 10 - 3  # Subtraction (-)
z = 10 * 2  # Multiplication (*)
a = 10 / 2  # Division (/)
b = 10 % 3  # Modulus (% gives remainder)
```

✅ **Comparison Operators**  
```python
print(10 > 5)  # True
print(10 == 10)  # True
print(10 != 5)  # True
```

✅ **Logical Operators**  
```python
print(True and False)  # False
print(True or False)  # True
print(not True)  # False
```

---

### **Q5: How do you take input from a user?**  
Use `input()` to take user input. Example:  
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```
🔹 If you enter `Ankita`, it prints **Hello, Ankita**.  

---

### **Q6: What are conditional statements (`if-else`)?**  
Conditional statements control decisions in a program.  

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")
```
🔹 If age is 20 → It prints **You are an adult**.  
🔹 If age is 15 → It prints **You are a minor**.  

---

### **Q7: What are loops (`for`, `while`) in Python?**  
✅ **`for` loop (Repeats a block of code multiple times)**  
```python
for i in range(5):  
    print("Hello")  
```
🔹 Prints **Hello** five times.  

✅ **`while` loop (Repeats until a condition is false)**  
```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Python is fun!")
    count += 1
```
🔹 Prints **Python is fun!** three times.  

---

### **Q8: What are functions in Python?**  
A **function** is reusable code that performs a task.  

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("Ankita")  # Calls the function
```
🔹 Output: **Hello, Ankita**  

---

## **3. Python Scripting Basics**  

### **Q9: What is Python scripting?**  
Python **scripting** is writing Python programs to automate tasks.  

✅ Examples of Python scripting:  
- Automating file handling (copy, move, delete files).  
- Running system commands (`ls`, `mkdir`, etc.).  
- Reading and writing to files (`.txt`, `.csv`).  

---

### **Q10: How to work with files in Python scripting?**  
✅ **Reading a file**  
```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```
✅ **Writing to a file**  
```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Python!")
```

---

### **Q11: How to execute system commands in Python?**  
Use `os` and `subprocess` modules.  

✅ **List files in a directory (Linux)**  
```python
import os
os.system("ls")
```
✅ **Run a shell command and get output**  
```python
import subprocess
output = subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(output.stdout)
```

---

### **Q12: How to automate tasks with Python scripting?**  
✅ **Scheduling a script to run automatically** (Linux example)  
Use a cron job:  
```bash
crontab -e
```
Add this line to run `script.py` every day at 9 AM:  
```
0 9 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py
```

---

## **4. Quick Python Scripting Example (Combining Concepts)**  
Here’s a script that:  
✅ Reads a file,  
✅ Counts the number of lines,  
✅ Prints system information.  

```python
import os

# Read file and count lines
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    print(f"Total lines: {len(lines)}")

# Get system information
print("Current Directory:", os.getcwd())
```

## **Conclusion**  
✔ **Python is easy to learn and powerful**.  
✔ **Python scripting helps automate tasks**.  
✔ **Learn variables, loops, functions, and file handling**.  
✔ **Use `os` and `subprocess` for system tasks**.
