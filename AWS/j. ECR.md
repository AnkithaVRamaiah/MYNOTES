# **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) – Complete Guide**  

## **📌 What is AWS ECR?**  
AWS **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)** is a **fully managed container image registry** that allows you to store, manage, and deploy **Docker container images** securely.  

### **🚀 Why Use AWS ECR?**  
✅ **Stores & Manages Container Images**  
✅ **Integrates with AWS Services (ECS, EKS, Lambda)**  
✅ **Secure & Scalable**  
✅ **Supports Private & Public Repositories**  

---

## **📌 How AWS ECR Works?**  

1️⃣ **Push Image** → Developers push container images to ECR from their local machine.  
2️⃣ **Store Image** → ECR stores the images securely with encryption.  
3️⃣ **Pull Image** → AWS services (ECS, EKS, Fargate, etc.) pull images when needed.  
4️⃣ **Deploy & Run** → The pulled image runs as a container on ECS, EKS, or other platforms.

## **📌 AWS ECR Key Components**  

| **Component**  | **Description**  |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Repositories**  | Stores Docker container images (public or private).  |
| **Images**  | Stored container images that can be pulled and deployed.  |
| **Registry**  | The AWS-managed service that stores repositories.  |
| **Lifecycle Policies**  | Rules to automatically delete old images.  |
| **Permissions**  | IAM-based access control for security.  |

## **📌 How to Use AWS ECR (Step-by-Step Guide)**  

### **✅ 1. Create an ECR Repository (AWS CLI Command)**  
```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo
```

### **✅ 2. Authenticate Docker with ECR**  
```bash
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

### **✅ 3. Build & Tag Docker Image**  
```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker tag my-app:latest <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-ecr-repo:latest
```

### **✅ 4. Push Image to ECR**  
```bash
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-ecr-repo:latest
```

### **✅ 5. Pull Image from ECR**  
```bash
docker pull <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-ecr-repo:latest
```

## **📌 AWS ECR Pricing**  
💰 **Pricing depends on:**  
- **Storage Cost** → Charged per GB of image storage.  
- **Data Transfer Cost** → Charged when pulling images outside AWS.  
- **Free Tier** → 500 MB of storage per month for private repositories.

### **3️⃣ How is ECR different from Docker Hub?**  
💬 **Answer:**  

| **Feature**  | **AWS ECR**  | **Docker Hub**  |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Fully managed by AWS | Third-party registry |
| **Security** | IAM-based authentication | Username-password authentication |
| **Cost** | Pay for storage & transfer | Free & paid plans |
| **Performance** | Fast access within AWS | Slower outside AWS |

### **4️⃣ How do you push an image to AWS ECR?**  
💬 **Answer:**  
1️⃣ Authenticate Docker with ECR  
2️⃣ Build & Tag the Image  
3️⃣ Push the Image using `docker push`  

**Example Command:**  
```bash
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-repo:latest
```

---

### **5️⃣ How do you pull an image from AWS ECR?**  
💬 **Answer:**  
You need to authenticate first, then pull the image using Docker:  
```bash
docker pull <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/my-repo:latest
```

---

### **6️⃣ What are Public and Private Repositories in ECR?**  
💬 **Answer:**  
- **Public Repositories** → Anyone can access and pull images.  
- **Private Repositories** → Access is restricted using IAM policies.  

---

### **7️⃣ How does AWS ECR secure container images?**  
💬 **Answer:**  
✅ **IAM Policies** → Restricts who can push/pull images.  
✅ **Encryption** → Uses AWS KMS for data security.  
✅ **Access Control** → Supports VPC endpoints for private access.  

---

### **8️⃣ What is the use of Lifecycle Policies in ECR?**  
💬 **Answer:**  
Lifecycle policies **automatically delete old images** to save storage costs and keep repositories clean.  

Example:  
- **Delete images older than 30 days**  
- **Keep only the last 10 images**  

---

### **9️⃣ How do you clean up old images in AWS ECR?**  
💬 **Answer:**  
You can **set up lifecycle policies** in ECR to automatically remove unused images.  

Example Rule:  
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "rulePriority": 1,
      "description": "Delete old images",
      "selection": {
        "tagStatus": "untagged",
        "countType": "imageCountMoreThan",
        "countNumber": 10
      },
      "action": {
        "type": "expire"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **🔟 Can AWS Lambda use ECR images?**  
💬 **Answer:**  
Yes! AWS Lambda supports **container images** stored in AWS ECR. Instead of ZIP-based functions, you can deploy **serverless applications** using Docker images.
