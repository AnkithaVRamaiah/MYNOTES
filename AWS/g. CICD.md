## **AWS CI/CD ‚Äì Complete Guide**  

AWS CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a **set of AWS services** that help developers **automate software development, testing, and deployment**. It ensures that code changes are tested and deployed efficiently.  

---

## **üìå What is CI/CD?**  

‚úÖ **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
- Developers frequently merge their code into a shared repository.  
- Automated tests run to detect errors early.  

‚úÖ **Continuous Deployment (CD)**  
- Code is automatically deployed to production after passing all tests.  
- Ensures faster delivery and fewer manual interventions.  

**Example**:  
A developer pushes code to GitHub ‚Üí AWS CI/CD pipeline tests & deploys the code ‚Üí Application updates automatically.

## **üìå AWS CI/CD Services**  

| **Service** | **Purpose** |
|------------|-------------|
| **AWS CodeCommit** | Git repository for version control |
| **AWS CodeBuild** | Builds and tests code automatically |
| **AWS CodeDeploy** | Automates application deployment |
| **AWS CodePipeline** | Orchestrates CI/CD workflows |
| **AWS CodeArtifact** | Stores and manages dependencies |
| **AWS CodeStar** | Manages CI/CD projects in one place |

## **üìå How AWS CI/CD Works?**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Developer pushes code** to **AWS CodeCommit / GitHub / Bitbucket**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **AWS CodePipeline** detects changes and starts the CI/CD process.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **AWS CodeBuild** compiles code and runs automated tests.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **AWS CodeDeploy** deploys the tested code to AWS services (EC2, Lambda, ECS, etc.).  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Deployment is completed**, and the application is updated.

                Provider: CodeCommit
                Version: '1'
              Configuration:
                RepositoryName: my-repo
                BranchName: main
              OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: SourceOutput
        - Name: Build
          Actions:
            - Name: BuildAction
              ActionTypeId:
                Category: Build
                Owner: AWS
                Provider: CodeBuild
                Version: '1'
              Configuration:
                ProjectName: my-build-project
              InputArtifacts:
                - Name: SourceOutput
              OutputArtifacts:
                - Name: BuildOutput
```

## **üìå AWS CI/CD Interview Questions & Answers**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is AWS CodePipeline?**  
üí¨ **Answer:**  
AWS CodePipeline is a **CI/CD orchestration service** that automates code building, testing, and deployment. It connects AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to create an automated CI/CD workflow.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ What is AWS CodeCommit?**  
üí¨ **Answer:**  
AWS CodeCommit is a **managed Git repository** for storing and managing source code securely. It integrates with AWS CI/CD services to trigger automatic builds and deployments.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ What is AWS CodeBuild?**  
üí¨ **Answer:**  
AWS CodeBuild is a **managed build service** that compiles code, runs tests, and produces deployable artifacts. It removes the need to manage build servers manually.

**Example Build Command**  
```bash
aws codebuild start-build --project-name my-build-project
```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ What is AWS CodeDeploy?**  
üí¨ **Answer:**  
AWS CodeDeploy automates code deployment to **EC2, Lambda, ECS, or On-Prem servers**. It supports **rolling, blue-green, and canary deployments** to minimize downtime.

**Example Deployment Command**  
```bash
aws deploy create-deployment --application-name MyApp --deployment-group-name MyDeploymentGroup --s3-location bucket=my-bucket,key=my-app.zip,bundleType=zip
```

---
