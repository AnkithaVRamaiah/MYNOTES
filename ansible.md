Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It simplifies IT automation by using a declarative language (YAML) and operates without requiring agents on managed nodes.

---

## **1. What is Ansible?**
Ansible is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that automates the management of systems, applications, and networks. It is agentless, meaning it doesn't require any software installation on the target machines.

### **Key Features**
- **Agentless:** Uses SSH for communication.
- **Idempotent:** Ensures that the desired state is achieved without unnecessary changes.
- **Declarative & Procedural:** Supports both approaches for automation.
- **Extensible:** Can be extended with modules, plugins, and custom scripts.
- **Human-Readable:** Uses YAML syntax in playbooks.

---

## **2. How Ansible Works**
Ansible operates using a **control node** (where Ansible is installed) to manage **target nodes** (which it configures).

### **Components**
- **Control Node:** The machine where Ansible runs (Linux/macOS).
- **Managed Nodes:** The machines being configured.
- **Inventory:** A file listing the target systems.
- **Playbooks:** YAML-based automation scripts.
- **Modules:** Predefined functions to execute tasks (e.g., install packages, restart services).
- **Plugins:** Extensions that add functionalities.
- **Roles:** A way to organize playbooks into reusable components.

### **Ansible Workflow**
1. Define **Inventory** of managed nodes.
2. Write **Playbooks** with tasks.
3. Execute with `ansible-playbook <playbook.yml>`.
4. Ansible connects via SSH and applies configurations.

## **3. Installation**
### **On Linux/macOS**
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible -y  # Debian-based
sudo yum install ansible -y  # RHEL-based
```
### **On Windows (WSL)**
```sh
sudo apt install ansible -y
```
### **Via Pip**
```sh
pip install ansible
```
---

## **4. Ansible Inventory**
The inventory file lists the managed hosts.
### **Default Inventory Location:**
`/etc/ansible/hosts`
### **Example Inventory (`hosts` file)**
```ini
[web]
webserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10 ansible_user=ubuntu

[db]
dbserver1 ansible_host=192.168.1.20 ansible_user=root
```

### **Ad-hoc Commands (Without Playbooks)**
```sh
ansible all -m ping  # Test connection to all hosts
ansible web -a "uptime"  # Check uptime of web servers
```

---

## **5. Ansible Playbooks**
Playbooks define automation steps in YAML.
### **Example Playbook (`install_apache.yml`)**
```yaml
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: web
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
```
### **Run Playbook**
```sh
ansible-playbook install_apache.yml
```

---

## **6. Ansible Modules**
Modules are used for executing tasks.

| Module | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `ping` | Checks connectivity |
| `copy` | Copies files to remote nodes |
| `file` | Manages file permissions |
| `service` | Manages services |
| `yum` / `apt` | Installs packages |
| `shell` | Runs shell commands |

### **Example: Copy a File**
```yaml
- name: Copy index.html
  copy:
    src: index.html
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
```

---

## **7. Ansible Roles**
Roles allow modular playbook organization.

### **Create a Role**
```sh
ansible-galaxy init myrole
```

### **Role Directory Structure**
```
myrole/
  ├── tasks/
  │   ├── main.yml
  ├── handlers/
  ├── templates/
  ├── files/
  ├── vars/
  ├── defaults/
```

### **Use a Role in Playbook**
```yaml
- hosts: web
  roles:
    - myrole
```

---

## **8. Ansible Variables & Templates**
Variables store dynamic values.

### **Define Variables in Playbook**
```yaml
- name: Install Package
  hosts: web
  vars:
    package_name: apache2
  tasks:
    - name: Install
      apt:
        name: "{{ package_name }}"
        state: present
```

### **Jinja2 Templates**
Templates allow dynamic file generation.

#### **Example (`index.html.j2` template)**
```html
<html>
  <h1>Welcome to {{ ansible_hostname }}</h1>
</html>
```
#### **Apply Template**
```yaml
- name: Deploy Webpage
  template:
    src: index.html.j2
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
```

---

## **9. Ansible Handlers**
Handlers are triggered on state changes.

### **Example**
```yaml
- name: Restart Apache
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: restarted
  listen: "restart apache"

- name: Install Apache
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  notify: "restart apache"
```

---

## **10. Ansible Loops & Conditionals**
### **Loops**
```yaml
- name: Install Multiple Packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  loop:
    - apache2
    - php
    - mysql-server
```

### **Conditionals**
```yaml
- name: Install Apache on Ubuntu
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
```

---

## **11. Ansible Tags**
Tags allow selective task execution.
```yaml
- name: Install Apache
  apt:
    name: apache2
    state: present
  tags: webserver
```
### **Run with a Tag**
```sh
ansible-playbook install_apache.yml --tags webserver
```

---

## **12. Ansible Vault (Secrets Management)**
Vault encrypts sensitive data.

### **Encrypt a File**
```sh
ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
```
### **Use Encrypted File in Playbook**
```yaml
vars_files:
  - secrets.yml
```
### **Decrypt & Edit**
```sh
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml
```

---

## **13. Ansible Best Practices**
1. **Use Roles** to organize playbooks.
2. **Keep Inventory Dynamic** (use dynamic inventory scripts).
3. **Limit Ad-hoc Commands** (use playbooks for repeatability).
4. **Use Ansible Vault** for sensitive data.
5. **Write Idempotent Tasks** (always check state before execution).
6. **Use Handlers Efficiently** (avoid unnecessary restarts).

- **Dynamic Inventory** – Auto-discover AWS, Azure, or Kubernetes hosts.
- **Ansible Collections** – Pre-packaged roles and plugins.
- **Integration with CI/CD** – Automate deployments with Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
